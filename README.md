# RayTracer
This repository follows the guide ("Ray Tracing in One Weekend)[https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview] by Peter Shirley, aiming to create a simple yet effective ray tracer from scratch using C++.

Overview
This project is an implementation of a basic ray tracing algorithm. Ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating realistic images by simulating the way rays of light interact with objects in a scene.
